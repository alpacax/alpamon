name: "Alpamon CodeQL Configuration"

# Alpamon is a secure server management agent for Alpacon.
# Remote command execution, file management, and user administration
# are core intended features, not vulnerabilities.
#
# Security Model:
# - Commands are received only from authenticated Alpacon console administrators
# - WebSocket connections require id/key header authentication
# - This is functionally equivalent to an SSH server
#
# False positives are suppressed with inline comments at specific locations
# to maintain security visibility for unintended vulnerabilities.
